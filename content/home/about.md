# Biography

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Columbia University, advised by Prof. [Luis Gravano](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~gravano/) and Prof. [Daniel Hsu](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~djhsu/). My research interests lie in the fields of Machine Learning, Information Extraction, and Natural Language Processing.  

Currently, I am working on weakly supervised learning frameworks for fine-grained text mining. In particular, I am interested in guiding learning and inference in deep neural networks using alternative supervision sources, such as domain-specific rules and noisy labels. I have applied weakly supervised models for mining social media for rare events related to public health. 

In the past, I have worked on human emotion recognition from conversational speech data, music information retrieval, and multimodal word embeddings grounded to the visual and auditory sense modalities. 

In addition to doing research, I love [playing funk n' jazz on my bass guitar](https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/11807801_612207592249738_2667282179281234100_o.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=0b5276f53588ad859e96b5e73bbd8815&oe=5BEE2F64), [windsurfing](https://www.facebook.com/gkaramanolakis/videos/10156571653667937/), [taking photos](https://www.instagram.com/giannis.karaman/?hl=en), and [traveling](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Hg-RXoDSAg1EN9HM81XvmO_KHM6L9q46&usp=sharing).
