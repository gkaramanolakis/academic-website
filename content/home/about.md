# Biography

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Columbia University, advised by Prof. Luis Gravano and Prof. Daniel Hsu. 

Currently, I am working on weakly supervised learning frameworks for fine-grained text mining. In particular, I am interested in guiding learning and inference in deep neural networks using alternative supervision sources, such as domain-specific rules and noisy labels. I have applied weakly supervised models for mining social media for rare events related to public health. 

In the past, I have worked on human emotion recognition from conversational speech data, music information retrieval, and multimodal word embeddings grounded to the visual and auditory sense modalities. 

In addition to doing research, I love playing funk n' jazz on my bass guitar, windsurfing, taking photos, and traveling.
